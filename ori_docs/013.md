Footage from the press conference released by the White House [[ 11 ]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate_LLC#cite_note-11)

The "Stargate" term dates back to 2024, when OpenAI and Microsoft started developing a $100 billion AI [supercomputer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercomputer) . [[ 12 ]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate_LLC#cite_note-:1-12)

On January 21, 2025, President Donald Trump announced the venture at a [White House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House) press conference, accompanied by [Sam Altman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Altman) from [OpenAI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI) , [Larry Ellison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Ellison) from [Oracle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Corporation) and [Masayoshi Son](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masayoshi_Son) from [SoftBank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SoftBank_Group) . [[ 5 ]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate_LLC#cite_note-:0-5)

Donald Trump called it "the largest AI infrastructure project in history", and he indicated that he would use emergency declarations to expedite the project's development, particularly regarding [energy infrastructure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_infrastructure) . [[ 13 ]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate_LLC#cite_note-13)

Larry Ellison contended that Stargate could lead to the AI-facilitated production of [mRNA vaccines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRNA_vaccine) against cancer, and that such vaccines could be designed "robotically", or by leveraging AI, "in about 48 hours". [[ 14 ]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate_LLC#cite_note-14)

The venture launched with an initial investment of $100 billion, with plans to increase it to $500 billion by 2029. [[ 12 ]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate_LLC#cite_note-:1-12) [Elon Musk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk) , CEO of OpenAI's competitor [xAI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XAI_(company)) , said that the venture lacked the financing to meet the promised investment levels. This was later denied by Sam Altman. [[ 15 ]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate_LLC#cite_note-15) [Arm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arm_Holdings) CEO [Rene Haas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rene_Haas) stated that the financial backing behind the project is "quite solid". [[ 16 ]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate_LLC#cite_note-16) reported that Softbank and OpenAI have each committed $19 billion of capital to initially fund Stargate and would each hold 40% ownership interest in the joint venture, while Oracle and MGX would each contribute $7 billion, and the remaining funds would be sourced from [limited partners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_partnership) and [debt financing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt_financing) . [[ 17 ]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate_LLC#cite_note-17) [[ 18 ]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate_LLC#cite_note-18) According to the , the infrastructure being built as part of the project will be exclusive to OpenAI. [[ 19 ]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate_LLC#cite_note-19) reported that SoftBank, the main financial backer for Stargate, could collect only a 10% equity funding and the remaining would come from debt or debt-like fundings. [[ 20 ]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate_LLC#cite_note-:2-20)

Coinciding with the project announcement, [Microsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft) and OpenAI signed a new agreement that grants Microsoft a [right of first refusal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_first_refusal) on future OpenAI cloud computing capacity, while allowing OpenAI to use other cloud providers if Microsoft declines. [[ 21 ]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate_LLC#cite_note-21)

On April 1, 2025, Softbank announced that its first $10 billion funding was expected to be borrowed from Japanese bank [Mizuho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mizuho_Financial_Group) and other lenders. [[ 20 ]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate_LLC#cite_note-:2-20)

On April 17, 2025, the Financial Times reported that OpenAI and Oracle weighed a future investment in the [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom) as they explored overseas locations to build out AI infrastructure. [[ 22 ]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate_LLC#cite_note-22)

On May 16, 2025, Nvidia, [Cisco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco) , and OpenAI announced plans to help build the "UAE Stargate" artificial intelligence data center in [United Arab Emirates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates) . [[ 23 ]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate_LLC#cite_note-:3-23) UAE Stargate is expected to open in 2026.

On May 22, 2025, [JPMorgan Chase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPMorgan_Chase) agreed to lend $2.3 billion to OpenAI and its partners for the Stargate data center projects in [Abilene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abilene,_Texas) , Texas. The project is being developed by a joint venture involving Blue Owl Capital, Crusoe Energy Systems, and Primary Digital Infrastructure, and is leased to Oracle Corporation. [[ 24 ]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate_LLC#cite_note-24)

## Structure

The venture is currently building 10 [data centers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_centers) in [Abilene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abilene,_Texas) , [Texas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas) , [[ 25 ]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate_LLC#cite_note-25) [[ 12 ]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate_LLC#cite_note-:1-12) and plans to expand to more states and countries like Japan and the United Arab Emirates, [[ 5 ]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate_LLC#cite_note-:0-5) [[ 26 ]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate_LLC#cite_note-26) [[ 23 ]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate_LLC#cite_note-:3-23) with Trump saying that he will use [executive orders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_orders) to help build the venture's infrastructure. The new venture claims that it will create more than 100,000 jobs in the United States. Altman has said that [SoftBank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SoftBank_Group) will have the "financial responsibility" of the venture and OpenAI will have the "operational responsibility". [[ 12 ]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate_LLC#cite_note-:1-12) [Arm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arm_Holdings) , [Microsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft) , [Nvidia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia) , [Oracle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Corporation) , and [OpenAI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI) are the key initial technology partners.
